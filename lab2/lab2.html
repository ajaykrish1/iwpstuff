    <h3 id="b6">6. German Shorthaired Pointer</h3>

      Designed for a very active pet parent, German Shorthaired Pointers are a
      high energy, endurance breed looking to spend almost all day outdoors. An
      ideal medium dog breed to take trailblazing along with your highly active
      family, you can guarantee this great dog will enjoy exploring both land
      and water with you. <a href="breed.html#b6">For more info</a>
    </p>
    <h3 id="b7">7. Great Dane</h3>
    <p>
      Best known for their friendly and patient demeanor, the Great Dane may
      fall into the largest breed of dog category but that doesn’t mean he needs
      a living space to match his size. This breed can be content in an
      apartment if there is enough space to stretch out and if regular, short
      walks are part of his daily routine.
